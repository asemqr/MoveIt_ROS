I. INTRODUCTION
In this report, we document the process of configuring and
controlling a robotic system using MoveIt and ROS, focusing
on tasks that demonstrate motion planning and execution. The
goal was to create and customize a MoveIt package for a
specific robot, simulate its behavior in Gazebo, and implement
code to move the end-effector along specified paths. The tasks
involved setting up the MoveIt library, moving the end-effector
by defined distances along the X-axis, and programming the
robot to trace shapes such as rectangles. These exercises
provided hands-on experience with robotic motion planning,
simulation, and programming within the ROS framework.


II. THEORY
For robotic manipulators, inverse kinematics (IK) translates a desired end-effector pose (position and orientation) in
Cartesian space into joint angles. For manipulators with more
than three degrees of freedom, calculating these joint angles
becomes increasingly complex due to the additional freedom
and redundancy in possible joint configurations.
In 3-DOF systems, solving IK analytically is often possible
since there are fewer joints and constraints. Hence, we were
able to solve the kinematics equations using algebraic in
the previous laboratory work. It involved 3-DOF manipulator
description with trigonometric relationships that are typically
always solvable using direct mathematical formulas.
Conversely, in 5-DOF systems, the increased joint number
makes analytical solutions impractical or infeasible. MoveIt
uses iterative, numerical approaches (such as Jacobian-based
methods) to solve for joint angles, especially when additional constraints like joint limits or collision avoidance are
considered. Therefore, we utilized Rviz (moveit) to calculate
the path and execute it Gazebo simulation through built-in
kinematics solvers that support 5DOF configurations. With
Moveit’s Kinematics Solver Plugin (such as KDL), we found
feasible joint solutions to achieve a desired pose by iterating
over possible configurations. This iterative solution differs
from the more straightforward algebraic methods suitable for
3-DOF systems.
Additionally, it was different with Cartesian Path Planning
as well. In MoveIt, the computeCartesianPath function enables
precise Cartesian control of the end-effector’s trajectory. This
function allows MoveIt to interpolate between points along
a Cartesian path, ensuring smooth, continuous end-effector
movement—critical for tasks requiring precise control in the
Cartesian space, such as assembly or complex motion tasks.
Finally, while for 3-DOF systems, redundancy is rarely an
issue because of the fewer number of possible configurations,
5-DOF robots need additional decision criteria to select an
optimal joint configuration. MoveIt addresses this with optimization plugins, which allow the selection of configurations
based on constraints like minimizing energy consumption,
staying within joint limits, or avoiding obstacles. These criteria are defined in MoveIt’s planning scene and IK solver
configurations.
III. METHODOLOGY


A. Task 1
In task 1, the primary objective was to configure the MoveIt
library to enable robot control and simulation. This was
achieved by creating a custom MoveIt package named moveitaidana using the MoveIt Setup Assistant. The setup process
involved defining the robot’s URDF model, configuring its
planning groups, setting up kinematic solvers, and generating
necessary configuration files for MoveIt integration. This stepby-step approach ensured that the MoveIt package was tailored
to the specific robot model and its capabilities.
To verify the configuration and run the simulation, we used
the command ”roslaunch gazebo-robot moveit-gazebo.launch”
to launch the Gazebo simulator with the robot model. Additionally, the command ”roslaunch moveit-aidana moveitplanning-execution.launch” was executed to initiate MoveIt in
RViz, which enabled planning and execution of the robot’s
movements. Through this process, we were able to control
the robot in RViz and simulate its behavior in Gazebo, using
the ”Plan and Execute” feature to move the robot to desired
positions.

B. Task 2
In task 2, the objective was to create a ROS node using
MoveIt that moves the robot’s end-effector by 1.4 units along
the x-axis, as visualized in RViz. The provided code accomplishes this task by utilizing the MoveIt MoveGroupInterface
to plan and execute the movement. The task began with
initializing the ROS node and setting up the move-group for
the planning group named ”move-aidana”, which corresponds
to the specific robot configuration in the MoveIt setup.
In Task 2, a miscommunication in the lab manual initially prevented successful movement of the robot in the
Gazebo simulation. The manual instructed creating a controllers real.yaml file in the moveit zhanat/config directory and
copying the configuration from the controllers real.yaml file
found in your workspace/src/snake-noetic/moveit arm/config.
The copied content included details specific to a different robot
group and controller structure, which were incompatible with
our simulation setup.
However, after further examination, it was determined that
the appropriate configuration should actually follow the structure found in the controllers.yaml file within snake-noetic,
moveit arm and then inside of config folder. This file contained
the correct controller list and joint definitions that aligned
with the current Gazebo and MoveIt simulation requirements.
By updating controllers real.yaml to reflect the correct setup,
communication between MoveIt and Gazebo was restored,
enabling the robot to move successfully in the simulation
environment.
The code first captured the current pose of the endeffector using move-group.getCurrentPose(). This pose
was stored as the current-pose, and a target-pose was
defined by modifying the x position to move the
end-effector 1.4 units backward along the x-axis (by
subtracting 1.4 from the current x-coordinate). The movegroup.setApproximateJointValueTarget(target-pose) method
was used to set the target pose for the robot’s end-effector,
and move-group.move() executed the motion command.
To ensure the move was completed successfully, a loop was
implemented where the code continually checked the current
pose against the target pose with a tolerance of 0.01 units. If
the difference between the current x-coordinate and the target
x-coordinate was within this tolerance, the loop terminated,
indicating that the end-effector reached the desired position.
The loop was controlled by ros::Rate loop-rate(50) to maintain
consistent pose checking and smooth execution.
This approach highlighted the fundamental principles of
using MoveIt for basic Cartesian path planning and movement, demonstrating how to adjust and execute end-effector
movements along a single axis. The task required modifying
the initial script by adjusting the movement value, showcasing
how to adapt existing MoveIt-based scripts for different motion
requirements.


C. Task 3
The task involved using the MoveIt framework within the
ROS (Robot Operating System) to command a robot’s endeffector to follow a rectangular trajectory. The objective was to
Fig. 2: Robot moving by 1.4 units in a straight line
control the robot’s movement step-by-step to draw a rectangle
by planning and executing movements between specified waypoints in Cartesian space. The process began with initializing
the ROS node and creating a MoveGroupInterface object for
the planning group ”move-aidana”, which is configured in the
MoveIt setup for the specific robot. The initial pose of the
end-effector was captured using move-group.getCurrentPose(),
and this pose was used as a reference for defining subsequent
waypoints.
The code directed the end-effector to move through four
main waypoints to complete the rectangle: moving left along
the negative x-axis by 1.4 meters, moving down along the
negative y-axis by 0.7 meters, shifting right along the positive
x-axis by 0.7 meters, and finally moving up along the positive
y-axis to return to the starting y-coordinate. For each step,
move-group.setApproximateJointValueTarget(target-pose) was
used to set the target pose, and move-group.move() executed
the movement. Each movement was verified by continuously
checking the current pose to ensure that the end-effector
reached the target within a 0.01-meter tolerance. The process
repeated in a loop controlled by ros::Rate loop-rate(50), ensuring smooth and regular position updates.
This method proved effective for creating simple paths
by defining and executing waypoint-based movements while
checking pose accuracy. It illustrated how Cartesian path
planning in MoveIt can be used for straightforward shapes like
rectangles. The approach emphasized precision by incorporating pose verification at each step, thus minimizing potential
cumulative errors. This task demonstrated MoveIt’s capability
to handle path planning and execution for simple geometric
paths and laid the groundwork for expanding to more complex
paths by adding further waypoints or adjustments.


D. Execution and Testing
For task 1, run ”roslaunch gazebo robot
moveit gazebo.launch” and ”roslaunch moveit aidana
moveit planning execution.launch” in seperate terminals to
control robot in RViz. Next, for task 2 run ”rosrun lab4
test moveit” to move the end-effector by 1.4 units and ”rosrun
lab4 test rectangle” for task 3 to draw a rectangle with the
end-effector. The video of the execution can be found at
